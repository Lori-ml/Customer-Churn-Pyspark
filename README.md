## Project Description

 

This project analyses a fictitious digital music provider under name Sparkify. Data has been provided in .json format and analysis was completed via pyspark. Main objects of this project are: **1.** Understand the behavior of churned customers and compare it with the un-churned ones.  **2.** Predict when a customer will churn while at the same time avoiding unwanted effects caused by false negatives. To reach these goals project has been divided in following sections:

 

**1. Data Understanding:**

        

 - Explores categorical and continuous data via different statistical methods

- Checks the dataset for missing values and reasons on dropping certain records.

- Derives new features based on raw data.

 

**2. Data Exploration:**

 

- This section uses different charts to compare churned vs un-churned customers.

 

**3. Feature Engineering**


 

- Based on above exploration transforms the dataset so that can be used in classification models.
