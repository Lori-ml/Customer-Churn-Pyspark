## Project Description

 

This project analyses a fictitious digital music provider under name Sparkify. Data has been provided in .json format and analysis was completed via pyspark. Main objects of this project are: **1.** Understand the behavior of churned customers and compare it with the un-churned ones.  **2.** Predict when a customer will churn while at the same time avoiding unwanted effects caused by false negatives. To reach these goals project has been divided in following sections:

 

**1. Data Understanding:**

        

 - Categorical and continuous data are explored via different statistical methods

- Dataset has been checked for data related issues (missing data, outliers). 

- Derives new features based on raw data.

 

**2. Data Exploration:**

 

- This section uses different charts to compare churned vs un-churned customers.

 

**3. Feature Engineering**


 

- Based on above exploration transforms the dataset so that can be used in classification models.
- New dataset is vectorized and scaled, ready for modeling.

**4. Modeling**
 
- Following models are applied in the dataset 1.Random Forest 2. Gradient Boosted Tree 3. Decision Tree 4. Support Vector Machine. 
- Above models are compared on f1-score and accuracy metrics.
- Best model (Random Forest) is later tuned via cross-validation technique.
- Feature importance for Random Forest has been printed.
